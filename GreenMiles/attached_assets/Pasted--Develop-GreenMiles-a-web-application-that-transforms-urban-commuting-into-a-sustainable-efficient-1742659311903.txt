"Develop GreenMiles, a web application that transforms urban commuting into a sustainable, efficient, and rewarding experience by integrating AI-driven public transportation optimization, electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions, and a token-based reward system. The platform targets commuters, businesses, and city planners, aiming to reduce emissions, lower energy costs, and promote eco-friendly choices in greener cities. Build a scalable, user-friendly prototype that showcases its core features and potential impact, using modern web technologies and mock data where necessary for demonstration purposes.
Project Overview
GreenMiles combines the functionalities of smart route optimization and EV charging management, enhanced with a token economy to incentivize sustainable behavior. Commuters benefit from optimized travel options and rewards, businesses gain analytics and cost-saving insights, and city planners access tools to improve urban mobility—all unified under one intuitive platform.

Key Features to Implement
1. Route Optimization
    * Leverage AI to suggest efficient routes for public transport (e.g., buses, trams) and EV users.
    * Factor in real-time traffic patterns, passenger demand, and energy consumption.
    * Prioritize routes and charging stations powered by renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind).
2. Renewable Energy Integration
    * Highlight public transport and charging stations using renewable energy.
    * Provide real-time data on energy sources for transparency (e.g., ‘This station is 80% solar-powered’).
3. Public Dashboard
    * Display live updates on route changes, charging station availability, and energy savings.
    * Make this section accessible to all users for visibility and community engagement.
4. Business Analytics
    * Offer businesses insights into employee commuting patterns and charger usage.
    * Include metrics on cost savings and tools to create discounts or promotions tied to the platform.
5. Token-Based Reward System
    * Earning Tokens: Users earn tokens by choosing optimized public transport routes or renewable-powered charging stations (e.g., 50 tokens for a solar-powered bus ride).
    * Redeeming Tokens: Tokens can be redeemed for discounts on public transport fares, electricity bills, or at participating businesses (e.g., 10% off an electricity bill for 50 tokens).
    * Track and display token transactions for users.
6. Impact Metrics
    * Calculate and showcase reductions in CO2 emissions, fuel costs, and energy usage.
    * Provide individual (e.g., ‘You saved 2 kg of CO2 today’) and community-wide impact stats.
7. User Experience Enhancements
    * Use AI to predict optimal EV charging times based on renewable energy availability, grid demand, and user schedules.
    * Include a simple reservation system for charging stations (e.g., ‘Reserve a slot at 3 PM’).

Website Structure
Design the GreenMiles website with a clear, intuitive layout catering to its three primary user groups:
1. Home Page
    * Overview of GreenMiles and its benefits: sustainability, cost savings, and efficiency.
    * Quick-start guide for new users.
    * Prominent call-to-action for the token system (e.g., ‘Start Earning Tokens Today!’).
2. Commuter Dashboard
    * Personalized interface showing optimized routes, charging station options, token earnings, and redemption history.
    * Example: ‘Priya, your bus today saved 2 kg of CO2 and earned you 50 tokens!’
3. Business Portal
    * Analytics dashboard with employee commuting data, charger usage stats, and cost savings.
    * Tools to offer discounts or promotions linked to token redemptions.
4. City Planner Tools
    * Interface for monitoring and adjusting public transport routes and charging station placements.
    * Display data on energy consumption and passenger demand trends.
5. Interactive Map
    * Real-time map showing optimized routes, charging station statuses (e.g., availability, energy source), and traffic conditions.

Technology Stack
Front-End
* Framework: Use React.js for a dynamic, component-based user interface.
* Responsive Design: Ensure compatibility across mobile and desktop devices using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
* Interactive Map: Integrate Leaflet.js or Google Maps API to display routes, charging stations, and traffic data.
* Data Visualization: Use Chart.js to create graphs and charts for analytics and impact metrics.
Back-End
* Framework: Use Node.js with Express for a lightweight, scalable server.
* API: Set up a RESTful API for communication between front-end and back-end.
* Database: Use MongoDB to store user profiles, routes, charging station data, token transactions, etc.
* Authentication: Implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user login and role-based access control (commuters, businesses, city planners).
AI Features
* Route Optimization: Implement basic pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A* or Dijkstra’s) considering traffic, demand, and energy use. Use mock data for traffic and demand.
* Charging Time Prediction: Simulate predictions with simple regression models or pre-set rules (e.g., ‘Charge when solar power peaks at noon’) using mock energy data.
* Tools: Use TensorFlow.js for lightweight AI integration or simulate results for the hackathon.
Real-Time Updates
* Library: Use Socket.io to push live updates on routes, charging availability, and energy sources.
* Simulation: Mock real-time data (e.g., changing station availability every few seconds) for demo purposes.

Implementation Steps
1. Project Setup
    * Initialize front-end (React) and back-end (Node.js/Express) repositories.
    * Set up version control with Git.
2. User Authentication
    * Build registration and login forms for commuters, businesses, and city planners.
    * Implement JWT for session management and role-based access.
3. Home Page
    * Create a landing page with an overview, benefits, and token system call-to-action.
    * Add a quick-start guide (e.g., a carousel or modal).
4. Interactive Map
    * Integrate Leaflet.js and populate with mock data for routes and charging stations.
    * Add markers for stations with status indicators (e.g., green for available, red for occupied).
5. Dashboards
    * Commuter Dashboard: Display mock routes, token earnings, and impact stats (e.g., ‘2 kg CO2 saved’).
    * Business Portal: Show sample analytics (e.g., bar charts of commuting patterns).
    * City Planner Tools: Provide a mock interface with adjustable routes and usage data.
6. AI Features
    * Simulate route optimization with a basic algorithm and display results on the map.
    * Mock charging time predictions (e.g., ‘Best time: 2 PM’) and integrate with the commuter dashboard.
7. Token System
    * Create a token tracking system (e.g., +50 tokens for a route, -50 for a discount).
    * Add a redemption interface with sample options (e.g., ‘10% off fare’).
8. Real-Time Updates
    * Use Socket.io to simulate live updates (e.g., station availability toggling every 10 seconds).
    * Reflect changes on the public dashboard and map.
9. Impact Metrics
    * Calculate mock CO2 and cost savings (e.g., based on route distance or energy type).
    * Display visually using Chart.js on dashboards.
10. Testing and Demo Prep
    * Test navigation, responsiveness, and feature integration.
    * Prepare a demo scenario: A commuter (Priya) takes a solar-powered bus, earns 50 tokens, and redeems them for a discount, with metrics updated live.

Additional Requirements
* Security: Implement basic input validation and error handling to prevent crashes or exploits.
* Performance: Optimize API calls and front-end rendering for a smooth experience with mock real-time data.
* User Experience: Include onboarding tooltips (e.g., ‘Click here to view your tokens’) and subtle animations (e.g., token count incrementing) for engagement.
* Demo Focus: Highlight a commuter’s journey, business analytics, and the token system in the hackathon presentation.

Expected Outcome
By following this prompt, you’ll create a functional prototype of GreenMiles that demonstrates:
* A commuter earning tokens by taking an optimized, renewable-powered route.
* A business viewing analytics and offering a discount.
* A city planner adjusting a route based on mock demand data.
* Real-time updates and impact metrics engaging all users.
This prototype will showcase GreenMiles’ potential to revolutionize sustainable commuting, making it a compelling hackathon submission!"
